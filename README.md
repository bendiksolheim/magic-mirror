Research day. Set up a parts list over some of the things needed to get this going. Finally decided to build a small mirror instead of a larger one so the display can draw power from the PI itself.

Also got hold of a UBS keyboard (only have the wireless ones at home!) and a micro HDMI connector. Got the PI booted and set up. Installed the magicmirror.builders software without trouble and booted the default config.

Got my Raspberry PI kit in the mail. Also bought a Sunfounder kit with a bread board and a few parts.

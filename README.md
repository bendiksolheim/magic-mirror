Hardly a session, but I spent some time looking for a display. After a lot of thinking, I want a small display that can use the Raspberry PI as a power source. Several exists, but most of them are touchscreens. Which would be a complete waste.

I will probably order https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hdmi-8-lcd-screen-kit-1024x768 – an 8 inch display powered by USB. It also has a decent resolution – more than enough to display some text.

Research day. Set up a parts list over some of the things needed to get this going. Finally decided to build a small mirror instead of a larger one so the display can draw power from the PI itself.

Also got hold of a UBS keyboard (only have the wireless ones at home!) and a micro HDMI connector. Got the PI booted and set up. Installed the magicmirror.builders software without trouble and booted the default config.

Got my Raspberry PI kit in the mail. Also bought a Sunfounder kit with a bread board and a few parts.
